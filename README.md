Simple hello-world repository

I'm Bryan and I am new to GitHub.  I am an aspiring web dev and I'm looking to get my start in the industry.
Everybody has to start somewhere.  I am currently following an online web dev bootcamp course made by Colt Steele (who is a fantastic teacher in my opinion).  I have been studying everything web dev for about 8 months now.  Trying to learn as much as possible while raising my family.  I am always open to advice, criticism, or just a chat.  Here is a list of what I have been using/learning.  I'm fairly competent with all of these: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, EJS, Cloud9 IDE, Sublime Text 3, Chrome Console.

Thanks for looking.
